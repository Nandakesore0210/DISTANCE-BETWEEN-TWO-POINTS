# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: Using import math function,do the calculations.
### Step 2: Take the two coordinates as l1 and l2.
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4: Using the print function, display the distance between the two points.
### Step 5: End the program.
### PROGRAM:

```
import math
list1=[4,2]
list2=[10,6]
distance=math.sqrt((list2[0]-list1[0])**2+(list2[1]-list1[1])**2)
print("%0.2f"%distance)
```

### OUTPUT:
